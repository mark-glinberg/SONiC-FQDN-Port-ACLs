## Description

This project aims to add functionality to SONiC, such that you can abstract creating ACL_RULES based on domain names, rather than IPs. Details can be found in this [design doc](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/p/t-mglinberg/Ebvl6HJ0W89Hs2ZuAmPDkiYBtTJn3yFt92AJRpQe8_dlhA?e=WhhaJG) (accessible only by MSFT employees).
